## Welcome to react-memory

My objective with this projects is training react + typescript and some others libs (styled-components, ...)

I'm learned more about components, useEffect/useState hooks, props, types of Props (includes props in styled-components), loops and conditionals.

Oh, this is my english level👍

Wait for more 😅💻
